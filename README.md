# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification

This project is my submission for the final project of "Machine Learning for Beginner" course by **Dicoding Academy**. The purpose of this project is to classify images of human hands making gestures of **"Rock"**, **"Paper"**, or **"Scissors"**.

## Dataset
This dataset contains 2188 images with 3 classes namely **"Rock"**, **"Paper"**, and **"Scissors"**.
The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip) 
or use this link by using wget command:
